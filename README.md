# WebScraping project

## This project was made to scrape the webstore: Mercado Livre
#
To made this code I used the lib BeautifulSoup and Selenium framework.<br/>
Returns a JSON file with the data scrapped, the information returned is: title product, link and price in reais (R$).
<br/>
<br/>
The BeautifulSoup function is to scrape the data obtained from the selenium script, it first searches the li tag where the necessary info is stored, after the scraping process the program saves the information in a JSON file.
